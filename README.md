## :bar_chart: Overview

The **Ecommerce Intelligence Dashboard** is a production-ready, modular analytics app that simulates a real-world data analytics workflow across five core modules:

- KPI Monitoring
- A/B Testing (single + simulation)
- Customer Segmentation
- CLV Modeling
- Time Series Forecasting

This project is designed to showcase end-to-end **data analysis**, **machine learning**, and **business intelligence** in a single interactive experience.

## :triangular_ruler: Key Features

### 1. KPI Dashboard
- Real-time filtering of transactional data
- KPIs: Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Transactions
- Visuals: Revenue over time, payment method distribution, revenue by category
- Actionable insights around pricing strategy and product performance

### 2. A/B Testing
- **Single Experiment Module**: Conversion lift, confidence intervals, z-test results
- **Simulation Module**: 100-run variability simulation of statistical lift
- Category-level interpretation and rollout recommendations

### 3. Customer Segmentation
- K-means clustering based on total spend, frequency, recency
- PCA visualization of behavioral clusters
- Strategic implications for marketing, churn prevention, and campaign targeting

### 4. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Modeling
- Predictive modeling of customer revenue potential
- Feature importance: avg order value, frequency, recency
- Visual breakdown of high-value vs low-value customer base

### 5. Sales Forecasting
- Daily revenue forecasts using Prophet
- Seasonal-trend decomposition and uncertainty intervals
- Practical use cases for supply chain, budget planning, and marketing timing
