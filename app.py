    - Roll out to Clothing and Electronics categories.
    - Reevaluate or A/B test Toys with an alternative treatment.

    In real-world scenarios, the outcome of an A/B test can vary based on sample size, randomness, or seasonality. Running simulations allows analysts to quantify the likelihood of observing meaningful lift or noise across runs. It's a best practice before rolling out a major update.

    **Key Observations:**
    - **Clothing and Electronics** segments maintain strong positive lift distributions with low variance.
    - **Home Goods** shows a wider spread but still positive central tendency, indicating moderate effect.
    - **Toys** consistently underperform, with most simulations suggesting negative lift.
    - **Beauty** fluctuates around zero, confirming a high-noise or low-signal effect.

    **Takeaway:**
    - Confidence in **Clothing, Electronics, and Home Goods** to perform reliably across customer samples.
    - **Toys** treatment likely needs redesign or different segmentation logic.
    - Avoid rolling out changes across **Beauty** without further targeted testing.

    Simulations like this are ideal for modeling uncertainty and decision-making under probabilistic confidence.
